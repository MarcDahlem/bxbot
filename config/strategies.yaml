strategies:

  # A unique identifier for the strategy. The markets.yaml tradingStrategyId entries reference this.
  # Value must be an alphanumeric string. Underscores and dashes are also permitted. E.g. my-macd-strat-1
  - id: intelligent-trailing-stop-strategy

    # A friendly name for the strategy.
    # Value must be an alphanumeric string. Spaces are allowed. E.g. My Super MACD Strat
    name: Intelligent Trailing Stop Strategy

    # The description value is optional.
    description: >
      Trails a stop order and changes the limits dynamically/intelligently according to the last order (positive --> higher limit, negative --> lower limit)

    # For the className value, you must specify the fully qualified name of your Strategy class for the
    # Trading Engine to load and execute. This class must be on the runtime classpath.
    # If you set this value to load your strategy, you cannot set the beanName value.
    #className: com.gazbert.bxbot.strategies.IntelligentTrailingStopStrategy

    # For the beanName value, you must specify the Spring bean name of you Strategy component class
    # for the Trading Engine to load and execute.
    # You will also need to annotate your strategy class with `@Component("exampleScalpingStrategy")` -
    # take a look at ExampleScalpingStrategy.java. This results in Spring injecting the bean.
    # (see https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/stereotype/Component.html)
    # If you set this value to load your strategy, you cannot set the className value.
    beanName: intelligentTrailingStopStrategy

    # The configItems section is optional and allows you to set custom key/value pair config items. This config
    # is passed to your Trading Strategy when the bot starts up.
    configItems:
      counter-currency-buy-order-amount: 20
      minimum-percentage-gain: 2
