    # This value is in SECONDS. It is the timeout value that the exchange adapter will wait on socket connect/socket read
    # when communicating with the exchange. Once this threshold has been breached, the exchange adapter will give up and
    # throw a Trading API TimeoutException.
    #
    # The exchange adapter is single threaded: if one request gets blocked, it will block all subsequent requests from
    # getting to the exchange. This timeout prevents an indefinite block.

    # You'll need to experiment with values here.

    # Optional java.io exception messages that will trigger the adapter to throw a non-fatal ExchangeNetworkException

    nonFatalErrorMessages:
      - Connection reset
      - Connection refused
      - Remote host closed connection during handshake
